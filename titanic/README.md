# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Project Overview
This project predicts Titanic passenger survival using machine learning in Python. The process includes data cleaning, feature engineering, model training (Logistic Regression), result evaluation, and visualizations.

## Steps
- Data loading and exploration
- Data cleaning (missing values, encoding)
- Model building and evaluation
- Visualization of key insights

## Results
- Model accuracy: ~81%
- Key predictors: Sex and Passenger Class

## How to Run
1. Download the notebook file (`your_notebook_name.ipynb`) and Titanic dataset (`train.csv`).
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter.
3. Run all cells from top to bottom.

## Insights
- Female and first-class passengers had higher survival chances.
- Visualizations highlight clear patterns in the data.

✅ Final Results
Accuracy: Around 81% — not bad for a basic model!

Most important factors:

Sex: Women had a much higher survival rate.

Passenger Class: First-class passengers had better chances of survival than those in lower classes.
